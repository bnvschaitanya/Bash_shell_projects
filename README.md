# Bash_shell_projects
**Userlock.sh Project**
This Bash script is designed to automate the process of locking a user account and creating a backup of the user's home directory. The script prompts the user for a username, checks whether the provided username exists on the system using the `id` command, and proceeds to lock the user account with `passwd -l`. It then retrieves the home directory path for the user from the `/etc/passwd` file, checks if the directory exists, and creates a tar archive of the home directory with a filename incorporating the username and a timestamp. The script ensures input validation, providing appropriate messages if the username is not provided or if the user does not exist. Overall, this script streamlines the task of securing a user account by locking it and concurrently creating a timestamped backup of the user's home directory for potential restoration.
